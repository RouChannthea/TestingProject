        <p>Erythroxylum novogranatense var. novogranatense (Colombian Coca) – a highland variety that is
                utilized in lowland areas. It is cultivated in drier regions found in Colombia. However,
                E. novogranatense is very adaptable to varying ecological conditions. The leaves have parallel
                lines on either side of the central vein.
